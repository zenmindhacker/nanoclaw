# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. Architecture lives in `docs/v2-*.md`.

## Quick Context (v2)

v2 is the current branch and codebase. v1 still exists under `src/v1/` and `container/agent-runner/src/v1/` for reference but is no longer the runtime. If a file mentions v1 in its comments, it is probably stale.

The host is a single Node process that orchestrates per-session agent containers. Platform messages land via channel adapters, route through an entity model (users → messaging groups → agent groups → sessions), get written into the session's inbound DB, and wake a container. The agent-runner inside the container polls the DB, calls Claude, and writes back to the outbound DB. The host polls the outbound DB and delivers through the same adapter.

**Everything is a message.** There is no IPC, no file watcher, no stdin piping between host and container. The two session DBs are the sole IO surface.

## Entity Model

```
users (id "<channel>:<handle>", kind, display_name)
user_roles (user_id, role, agent_group_id)       — owner | admin (global or scoped)
agent_group_members (user_id, agent_group_id)    — unprivileged access gate
user_dms (user_id, channel_type, messaging_group_id) — cold-DM cache

agent_groups (workspace, memory, CLAUDE.md, personality, container config)
    ↕ many-to-many via messaging_group_agents (session_mode, trigger_rules, priority)
messaging_groups (one chat/channel on one platform; unknown_sender_policy)

sessions (agent_group_id + messaging_group_id + thread_id → per-session container)
```

Privilege is user-level (owner/admin), not agent-group-level. See [docs/v2-isolation-model.md](docs/v2-isolation-model.md) for the three isolation levels (`agent-shared`, `shared`, separate agents).

## Two-DB Session Split

Each session has **two** SQLite files under `data/v2-sessions/<session_id>/`:

- `inbound.db` — host writes, container reads. `messages_in`, routing, destinations, pending_questions, processing_ack.
- `outbound.db` — container writes, host reads. `messages_out`, session_state.

Exactly one writer per file — no cross-mount lock contention. Heartbeat is a file touch at `/workspace/.heartbeat`, not a DB update. Host uses even `seq` numbers, container uses odd.

## Central DB

`data/v2.db` holds everything that isn't per-session: users, user_roles, agent_groups, messaging_groups, wiring, pending_approvals, pending_credentials, pending_swaps, user_dms, chat_sdk_* (for the Chat SDK bridge), schema_version. Migrations live at `src/db/migrations/`.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point: init DB, migrations, channel adapters, delivery polls, sweep, shutdown |
| `src/router.ts` | Inbound routing: messaging group → agent group → session → `inbound.db` → wake |
| `src/delivery.ts` | Polls `outbound.db`, delivers via adapter, handles system actions (schedule, approvals, etc.) |
| `src/host-sweep.ts` | 60s sweep: `processing_ack` sync, stale detection, due-message wake, recurrence |
| `src/session-manager.ts` | Resolves sessions; opens `inbound.db` / `outbound.db`; manages heartbeat path |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns per-agent-group Docker containers with session DB + outbox mounts, OneCLI `ensureAgent` |
| `src/container-runtime.ts` | Runtime selection (Docker vs Apple containers), orphan cleanup |
| `src/access.ts` | `pickApprover`, `pickApprovalDelivery`, admin resolution for `NANOCLAW_ADMIN_USER_IDS` |
| `src/onecli-approvals.ts` | OneCLI credentialed-action approval bridge |
| `src/credentials.ts` | `trigger_credential_collection` host side — modal, OneCLI write-back |
| `src/user-dm.ts` | Cold-DM resolution + `user_dms` cache |
| `src/group-init.ts` | Per-agent-group filesystem scaffold (CLAUDE.md, skills, agent-runner-src overlay) |
| `src/builder-agent/` | Self-modification feature: dev-agent spawn, worktree, classifier, swap, deadman, promote. See `docs/v2-builder-agent-plan.md` |
| `src/db/` | DB layer — agent_groups, messaging_groups, sessions, user_roles, user_dms, pending_*, migrations |
| `src/channels/` | Channel adapters + Chat SDK bridge |
| `container/agent-runner/src/` | Agent-runner: poll loop, formatter, provider abstraction, MCP tools, destinations |
| `container/skills/` | Container skills mounted into every agent session |
| `groups/<folder>/` | Per-agent-group filesystem (CLAUDE.md, skills, `agent-runner-src/` overlay for builder-agent) |
| `scripts/init-first-agent.ts` | Bootstrap the first DM-wired agent (used by `/init-first-agent` skill) |

## Self-Modification

Three tiers of agent self-modification, lightest first:

1. **`install_packages` / `add_mcp_server` / `request_rebuild`** — changes to the per-agent-group container config only (apt/npm deps, wire an existing MCP server). Admin approval, rebuild, container restart. `container/agent-runner/src/mcp-tools/self-mod.ts`.
2. **`trigger_credential_collection`** — user provides an API key via a secure modal; value goes straight into OneCLI and never enters agent context. `src/credentials.ts`.
3. **`create_dev_agent` + `request_swap`** — heaviest path. Agent spawns a dev-agent clone in a git worktree overlaid with the group's private `agent-runner-src/`, the dev agent edits source, the host classifies the diff, routes for approval, applies a per-path swap, and runs a deadman-restart dance. Every swap commits to `main` for audit. Full design in [docs/v2-builder-agent-plan.md](docs/v2-builder-agent-plan.md).

## Secrets / Credentials / OneCLI

API keys, OAuth tokens, and auth credentials are managed by the OneCLI gateway. Secrets are injected into per-agent containers at request time — none are passed in env vars or through chat context. `src/onecli-secrets.ts`, `src/onecli-approvals.ts`, `ensureAgent()` in `container-runner.ts`. Run `onecli --help`.

## Skills

Four types of skills. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy.

- **Feature skills** — `skill/*` branches merged via `scripts/apply-skill.ts` (e.g. `/add-discord-v2`, `/add-slack-v2`, `/add-whatsapp-v2`)
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside `SKILL.md` (e.g. `/claw`)
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows (`/setup`, `/debug`, `/customize`, `/init-first-agent`, `/manage-channels`, `/init-onecli`, `/update-nanoclaw`)
- **Container skills** — loaded inside agent containers at runtime (`container/skills/`: `welcome`, `self-customize`, `agent-browser`, `slack-formatting`)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time install, auth, service config |
| `/init-first-agent` | Bootstrap the first DM-wired agent (channel pick → identity → wire → welcome DM) |
| `/manage-channels` | Wire channels to agent groups with isolation level decisions |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, behavior changes |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-nanoclaw` | Bring upstream updates into a customized install |
| `/init-onecli` | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials |

## Contributing

Before creating a PR, adding a skill, or preparing any contribution, you MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers accepted change types, the four skill types and their guidelines, `SKILL.md` format rules, and the pre-submission checklist.

## Development

Run commands directly — don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Host with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile host TypeScript (src/)
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container image (nanoclaw-agent:latest)
npm test             # Host tests
```

Container typecheck is a separate tsconfig — if you edit `container/agent-runner/src/`, run `npx tsc -p container/agent-runner/tsconfig.json --noEmit` to check it.

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start|stop|restart nanoclaw
```

Host logs: `logs/nanoclaw.log` (normal) and `logs/nanoclaw.error.log` (errors only — some delivery/approval failures only show up here).

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.
