# ⚠️ STOP — READ THIS FIRST IF YOU ARE CLAUDE ⚠️

**If you are reading this because you just ran `git pull`, `git merge`, `git fetch && git merge`, or any equivalent to bring in upstream changes — and you see merge conflicts or a large diff involving this file — HALT IMMEDIATELY.**

This is NanoClaw v2, a ground-up rewrite with breaking changes throughout. It cannot be merged into an existing v1 install. Attempting to resolve the conflicts by hand, run builds, or "fix" anything will corrupt the user's install and burn tokens for no result.

**Do this instead:**
1. Abort the merge: `git merge --abort` (or `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` if the merge already completed).
2. Tell the user, verbatim: *"This is the v2 rewrite — it can't be merged into your existing install. Exit Claude Code (or open a separate terminal) and run `bash migrate-v2.sh` from the shell."*
3. Wait for the user to confirm before doing anything else. Do not run the migration script yourself — it requires an interactive terminal and cannot be run from within Claude Code.

If you are a fresh install (you ran `git clone`, not `git pull`) and there are no conflicts, ignore this banner and continue below.

# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. Architecture lives in `docs/`.

## Quick Context

The host is a single Node process that orchestrates per-session agent containers. Platform messages land via channel adapters, route through an entity model (users → messaging groups → agent groups → sessions), get written into the session's inbound DB, and wake a container. The agent-runner inside the container polls the DB, calls Claude, and writes back to the outbound DB. The host polls the outbound DB and delivers through the same adapter.

**Everything is a message.** There is no IPC, no file watcher, no stdin piping between host and container. The two session DBs are the sole IO surface.

## Find the NanoClaw Way First

Before changing state, adding operational behavior, or repairing production data, look for the established NanoClaw path first. Check relevant skills in `.claude/skills/`, docs, `ncl` commands, scripts, MCP tools, and module APIs before inventing a one-off approach.

Prefer the highest-level maintained interface that exists: skills for installed capabilities, `ncl` for admin operations, scheduling MCP/tools or `src/modules/scheduling/*` for tasks, migration/import scripts for data moves, and DB helpers for direct DB writes. Treat raw SQLite edits, ad-hoc shell patches, and hand-built rows as last resorts; if you use one, explain why no higher-level path fits and record enough detail to replace it with the proper path later.

## Entity Model

```
users (id "<channel>:<handle>", kind, display_name)
user_roles (user_id, role, agent_group_id)       — owner | admin (global or scoped)
agent_group_members (user_id, agent_group_id)    — unprivileged access gate
user_dms (user_id, channel_type, messaging_group_id) — cold-DM cache

agent_groups (workspace, memory, CLAUDE.md, personality, container config)
    ↕ many-to-many via messaging_group_agents (session_mode, trigger_rules, priority)
messaging_groups (one chat/channel on one platform; unknown_sender_policy)

sessions (agent_group_id + messaging_group_id + thread_id → per-session container)
```

Privilege is user-level (owner/admin), not agent-group-level. See [docs/isolation-model.md](docs/isolation-model.md) for the three isolation levels (`agent-shared`, `shared`, separate agents).

## Two-DB Session Split

Each session has **two** SQLite files under `data/v2-sessions/<session_id>/`:

- `inbound.db` — host writes, container reads. `messages_in`, routing, destinations, pending_questions, processing_ack.
- `outbound.db` — container writes, host reads. `messages_out`, session_state.

Exactly one writer per file — no cross-mount lock contention. Heartbeat is a file touch at `/workspace/.heartbeat`, not a DB update. Host uses even `seq` numbers, container uses odd.

## Central DB

`data/v2.db` holds everything that isn't per-session: users, user_roles, agent_groups, messaging_groups, wiring, pending_approvals, user_dms, chat_sdk_* (for the Chat SDK bridge), schema_version. Migrations live at `src/db/migrations/`.

For ad-hoc queries from skills or scripts, use the in-tree wrapper rather than the `sqlite3` CLI: `pnpm exec tsx scripts/q.ts <db> "<sql>"`. The host setup intentionally avoids depending on the `sqlite3` binary (`setup/verify.ts:5`); the wrapper goes through the `better-sqlite3` dep that setup already installs and verifies. Default-output format matches `sqlite3 -list` (pipe-separated, no header) so existing skill text reads identically.

See [docs/migration-dev.md](docs/migration-dev.md). |

## Admin CLI (`ncl`)

`ncl` queries and modifies the central DB — agent groups, messaging groups, wirings, users, roles, and more. On the host it connects via Unix socket (`src/cli/socket-server.ts`); inside containers it uses the session DB transport (`container/agent-runner/src/cli/ncl.ts`).

```
ncl <resource> <verb> [<id>] [--flags]
ncl <resource> help
ncl help
```

| Resource | Verbs | What it is |
|----------|-------|------------|
| groups | list, get, create, update, delete, restart, config get/update, config add-mcp-server/remove-mcp-server, config add-package/remove-package | Agent groups (workspace, personality, container config) |
| messaging-groups | list, get, create, update, delete | A single chat/channel on one platform |
| wirings | list, get, create, update, delete | Links a messaging group to an agent group (session mode, triggers) |
| users | list, get, create, update | Platform identities (`<channel>:<handle>`) |
| roles | list, grant, revoke | Owner / admin privileges (global or scoped to an agent group) |
| members | list, add, remove | Unprivileged access gate for an agent group |
| destinations | list, add, remove | Where an agent group can send messages |
| sessions | list, get | Active sessions (read-only) |
| user-dms | list | Cold-DM cache (read-only) |
| dropped-messages | list | Messages from unregistered senders (read-only) |
| approvals | list, get | Pending approval requests (read-only) |

Key files: `src/cli/dispatch.ts` (dispatcher + approval handler), `src/cli/crud.ts` (generic CRUD registration), `src/cli/resources/` (per-resource definitions).

## Channels and Providers (skill-installed)

Trunk does not ship any specific channel adapter or non-default agent provider. The codebase is the registry/infra; the actual adapters and providers live on long-lived sibling branches and get copied in by skills:

- **`channels` branch** — Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Teams, Linear, GitHub, iMessage, Webex, Resend, Matrix, Google Chat, WhatsApp Cloud (+ helpers, tests, channel-specific setup steps). Installed via `/add-<channel>` skills.
- **`providers` branch** — OpenCode (and any future non-default agent providers). Installed via `/add-opencode`.

Each `/add-<name>` skill is idempotent: `git fetch origin <branch>` → copy module(s) into the standard paths → append a self-registration import to the relevant barrel → `pnpm install <pkg>@<pinned-version>` → build.

## Self-Modification

One tier of agent self-modification today:

1. **`install_packages` / `add_mcp_server`** — changes to the per-agent-group container config in the DB (apt/npm deps, wire an existing MCP server). Single admin approval per request; on approve, the handler in `src/modules/self-mod/apply.ts` rebuilds the image when needed (`install_packages` only), writes an `on_wake` message, kills the container, and respawns via `onExit` callback. The on-wake message is only picked up by the fresh container's first poll — dying containers can never steal it. `container/agent-runner/src/mcp-tools/self-mod.ts`.

A second tier (direct source-level self-edits via a draft/activate flow) is planned but not yet implemented.

## Container Config

Per-agent-group container runtime config (provider, model, packages, MCP servers, mounts, etc.) lives in the `container_configs` table in the central DB. Materialized to `groups/<folder>/container.json` at spawn time so the container runner can read it. Managed via `ncl groups config get/update` and the self-mod MCP tools.

**`cli_scope`** — controls what the agent can do with `ncl` from inside the container:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `disabled` | Agent never learns about ncl (instructions excluded from CLAUDE.md). Host dispatch rejects any `cli_request`. |
| `group` (default) | Agent can access `groups`, `sessions`, `destinations`, `members` only, scoped to its own agent group. `--id` and group args are auto-filled. Cross-group access rejected. `cli_scope` changes blocked. |
| `global` | Unrestricted. Set automatically for owner agent groups via `init-first-agent`. |

Key files: `src/db/container-configs.ts`, `src/container-config.ts`, `src/cli/dispatch.ts` (scope enforcement), `src/claude-md-compose.ts` (instructions exclusion).

## Container Restart

`ncl groups restart --id <group-id> [--rebuild] [--message <text>]`. Kills running containers; if `--message` is provided, writes an `on_wake` message and respawns via `onExit` callback. Without `--message`, containers come back on the next user message. From inside a container, `--id` is auto-filled and only the calling session is restarted.

The `on_wake` column on `messages_in` ensures wake messages are only picked up by a fresh container's first poll iteration. This prevents the race where a dying container (still in its SIGTERM grace period) could steal the message. `killContainer` accepts an optional `onExit` callback that fires after the process exits, guaranteeing the old container is gone before the new one spawns.

Key files: `src/container-restart.ts`, `src/container-runner.ts` (`killContainer`), `container/agent-runner/src/db/messages-in.ts` (`getPendingMessages`).

## Secrets / Credentials / OneCLI

API keys, OAuth tokens, and auth credentials are managed by the OneCLI gateway. Secrets are injected into per-agent containers at request time — none are passed in env vars or through chat context. The container agent sees this via the `onecli-gateway` container skill (`container/skills/onecli-gateway/SKILL.md`), which teaches it how the proxy works, how to handle auth errors, and to never ask for raw credentials. Host-side wiring: `src/onecli-approvals.ts`, `ensureAgent()` in `container-runner.ts`. Run `onecli --help`.

### Gotcha: auto-created agents start in `selective` secret mode

When the host first spawns a session for a new agent group, `container-runner.ts:385` calls `onecli.ensureAgent({ name, identifier })`. The OneCLI `POST /api/agents` endpoint creates the agent in **`selective`** secret mode — meaning **no secrets are assigned to it by default**, even if the secrets exist in the vault and have host patterns that would otherwise match.

Symptom: container starts, the proxy + CA cert are wired correctly, but the agent gets `401 Unauthorized` (or similar) from APIs whose credentials *are* in the vault. The credential just isn't in this agent's allow-list.

The SDK does not expose `setSecretMode` — the only fix is the CLI (or the web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:10254`).

```bash
# Find the agent (identifier is the agent group id)
onecli agents list

# Flip to "all" so every vault secret with a matching host pattern gets injected
onecli agents set-secret-mode --id <agent-id> --mode all

# Or, stay selective and assign specific secrets
onecli secrets list                                    # find secret ids
onecli agents set-secrets --id <agent-id> --secret-ids <id1>,<id2>

# Inspect what an agent currently has
onecli agents secrets --id <agent-id>                  # secrets assigned to this agent
onecli secrets list                                    # all vault secrets (with host patterns)
```

If you've just enabled `mode all`, no container restart is needed — the gateway looks up secrets per request, so the next API call from the running container will see the new credentials.

### Requiring approval for credential use

Approval-gating credentialed actions is a **two-sided** flow:

- **Server-side** (OneCLI gateway): decides *when* to hold a request and emit a pending approval. As of `onecli@1.3.0`, the CLI does **not** expose this — `rules create --action` only accepts `block` or `rate_limit`, and `secrets create` has no approval flag. Approval policies must be configured via the OneCLI web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:10254`. If/when the CLI grows an `approve` action, this section needs updating.
- **Host-side** (nanoclaw): receives pending approvals and routes them to a human. `src/modules/approvals/onecli-approvals.ts` registers a callback via `onecli.configureManualApproval(cb)` (long-polls `GET /api/approvals/pending`). The callback uses `pickApprover` + `pickApprovalDelivery` from `src/modules/approvals/primitive.ts` to DM an approver. Approvers are resolved from the `user_roles` table — preference order: scoped admins for the agent group → global admins → owners. There is no env var like `NANOCLAW_ADMIN_USER_IDS`; roles are persisted in the central DB only.

If approvals are configured server-side but the host callback isn't running (or throws), every credentialed call hangs until the gateway times out. Conversely, if the gateway has no rule asking for approval, the host callback never fires regardless of how it's wired.

## Skills

Four types of skills. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy.

- **Channel/provider install skills** — copy the relevant module(s) in from the `channels` or `providers` branch, wire imports, install pinned deps (e.g. `/add-discord`, `/add-slack`, `/add-whatsapp`, `/add-opencode`).
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside `SKILL.md` (e.g. `/claw`).
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows (`/setup`, `/debug`, `/customize`, `/init-first-agent`, `/manage-channels`, `/init-onecli`, `/update-nanoclaw`).
- **Container skills** — loaded inside agent containers at runtime (`container/skills/`: `onecli-gateway`, `welcome`, `self-customize`, `agent-browser`, `slack-formatting`).

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time install, auth, service config |
| `/init-first-agent` | Bootstrap the first DM-wired agent (channel pick → identity → wire → welcome DM) |
| `/manage-channels` | Wire channels to agent groups with isolation level decisions |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, behavior changes |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-nanoclaw` | Bring upstream updates into a customized install |
| `/init-onecli` | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials |

## Agent-owned code (Cleo / Silas)

Durable scripts, `CLAUDE.local.md`, and per-group assets live under `agents/cleo/groups/` and `agents/silas/groups/` (active v2 folder per channel). **Commit and push** after agent-authored changes; do not leave server-only copies. Runtime state (`data/`, session DBs, `logs/`) and credentials stay out of git. Full policy: [docs/agent-owned-code.md](docs/agent-owned-code.md). Server updates: [docs/server-sync.md](docs/server-sync.md).

## Two-Agent Setup: Cleo and Silas

Before creating a PR, adding a skill, or preparing any contribution, you MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers accepted change types, the four skill types and their guidelines, `SKILL.md` format rules, and the pre-submission checklist.

## PR Hygiene

Before creating a PR, run these checks:

```bash
git diff upstream/main --stat HEAD
git log upstream/main..HEAD --oneline
```

Show the output and wait for approval. Installation-specific files (group files, .claude/settings.json, local configs) should not be included.

## Development

Run commands directly — don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
# Host (Node + pnpm)
pnpm run dev          # Host with hot reload
pnpm run build        # Compile host TypeScript (src/)
./container/build.sh  # Rebuild agent container image (nanoclaw-agent:latest)
pnpm test             # Host tests (vitest)

# Agent-runner (Bun — separate package tree under container/agent-runner/)
cd container/agent-runner && bun install   # After editing agent-runner deps
cd container/agent-runner && bun test      # Container tests (bun:test)
```

Container typecheck is a separate tsconfig — if you edit `container/agent-runner/src/`, run `pnpm exec tsc -p container/agent-runner/tsconfig.json --noEmit` from root (or `bun run typecheck` from `container/agent-runner/`).

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start|stop|restart nanoclaw
```

## Troubleshooting

Check these first when something goes wrong:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Host logs | `logs/nanoclaw.error.log` first (delivery failures, crash-loop backoff, warnings), then `logs/nanoclaw.log` for the full routing chain |
| Setup logs | `logs/setup.log` (overall), `logs/setup-steps/*.log` (per-step: bootstrap, environment, container, onecli, mounts, service, etc.) |
| Session DBs | `data/v2-sessions/<agent-group>/<session>/` — `inbound.db` (`messages_in`: did the message reach the container?), `outbound.db` (`messages_out`: did the agent produce a response?) |

Note: container logs are lost after the container exits (`--rm` flag). If the agent silently failed inside the container, there's no persistent log to inspect.

## Supply Chain Security (pnpm)

This project uses pnpm with `minimumReleaseAge: 4320` (3 days) in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. New package versions must exist on the npm registry for 3 days before pnpm will resolve them.

**Rules — do not bypass without explicit human approval:**
- **`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`**: Never add entries without human sign-off. If a package must bypass the release age gate, the human must approve and the entry must pin the exact version being excluded (e.g. `package@1.2.3`), never a range.
- **`onlyBuiltDependencies`**: Never add packages to this list without human approval — build scripts execute arbitrary code during install.
- **`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`** should be used in CI, automation, and container builds. Never run bare `pnpm install` in those contexts.

## OAuth Token Management

OAuth tokens live in `~/.config/nanoclaw/credentials/services/` and are auto-refreshed by `src/oauth-refresher.ts` on the host.

### Standard Token Format
All token files use consistent fields:
- `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at` (Unix seconds), `scope`, `token_type`
- Metadata: `provider` (google/xero), `account` (email), `org` (company)
- Google tokens also keep `expiry_date` (ms) for `googleapis` library compat

### OAuth Registry
`~/.config/nanoclaw/credentials/services/oauth-registry.json` maps each token file to its provider, client credential file, refresh endpoint, and metadata. The host refresher reads this on each cycle.

### Refresh Architecture
- **Host refresher** (`src/oauth-refresher.ts`): Runs every 30 min in the main process. Proactively refreshes tokens expiring within 35 min (buffer exceeds check interval so tokens can't expire between cycles). Failures alert `#sysops` via `OAUTH_ALERT_SLACK_CHANNEL` (default `slack:C07F195GB96`).
- **Container consumers**: Read tokens from `/workspace/extra/credentials/` (read-only mount). Do not write host OAuth token files from containers.
- **Cleo repair path**: `ncl oauth-health`, `ncl oauth-refresh-now`, `ncl oauth-refresh-one --id <registry-id>` (host executes; agents with CLI access). Optional read-only scheduled `oauth-health-check` wakes Cleo when the pre-script gate finds problems.
- **No legacy writer task**: Do not recover v1 `oauth-token-refresh` (it duplicated refresh). Use `oauth-health-check` from `scripts/scheduled-tasks.manifest.json` instead.

Runbook: [docs/oauth-hybrid-repair.md](docs/oauth-hybrid-repair.md).

### Adding a New OAuth Token
1. Run the provider's auth flow to get initial tokens
2. Save to `~/.config/nanoclaw/credentials/services/<name>-token.json` using standard format
3. Add entry to `oauth-registry.json` with provider, client_file, account, org
4. Add token + client file to `data/secrets-manifest.json`
5. Host refresher picks it up automatically on next cycle

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.

## Container Runtime (Bun)

The agent container runs on **Bun**; the host runs on **Node** (pnpm). They communicate only via session DBs — no shared modules. Details and rationale: [docs/build-and-runtime.md](docs/build-and-runtime.md).

**Gotchas — trigger + action:**

- **Adding or bumping a runtime dep in `container/agent-runner/`** → edit `package.json`, then `cd container/agent-runner && bun install` and commit the updated `bun.lock`. Do not run `pnpm install` there — agent-runner is not a pnpm workspace.
- **Bumping `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, or any agent-runner runtime dep** → no `minimumReleaseAge` policy applies to this tree. Check the release date on npm, pin deliberately, never `bun update` blindly.
- **Writing a new named-param SQL insert/update in the container** → use `$name` in both SQL and JS keys: `.run({ $id: msg.id })`. `bun:sqlite` does not auto-strip the prefix the way `better-sqlite3` does on the host. Positional `?` params work normally.
- **Adding a test in `container/agent-runner/src/`** → import from `bun:test`, not `vitest`. Vitest runs on Node and can't load `bun:sqlite`. `vitest.config.ts` excludes this tree.
- **Adding a Node CLI the agent invokes at runtime** (like `agent-browser`, `claude-code`, `vercel`) → put it in the Dockerfile's pnpm global-install block, pinned to an exact version via a new `ARG`. Don't use `bun install -g` — that bypasses the pnpm supply-chain policy.
- **Changing the Dockerfile entrypoint or the dynamic-spawn command** (`src/container-runner.ts` line ~301) → keep `exec bun ...` so signals forward cleanly. The image has no `/app/dist`; don't reintroduce a tsc build step.
- **Changing session-DB pragmas** (`container/agent-runner/src/db/connection.ts`) → `journal_mode=DELETE` is load-bearing for cross-mount visibility. Read the comment block at the top of the file first.

## Two-Agent Setup: Cleo and Silas

This repo is the **canonical codebase for two agents** that share identical code but run with separate personas and credentials.

| Agent | Persona | Server user | Port | Groups dir |
|-------|---------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Cleo** | Cian's assistant | `cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net` | 3001 | `agents/cleo/groups/` |
| **Silas** | Christina's assistant | `christina@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net` | 3003 | `agents/silas/groups/` |

Both agents pull from **`https://github.com/zenmindhacker/nanoclaw`** (this repo).

### What differs per agent

- **`agents/{agent}/groups/`** — CLAUDE.md persona files and per-group configs (in git)
- **`.env`** — credentials, `GROUPS_DIR`, `DATA_DIR` (on server only, never in git)
- **`data/`** — runtime state: SQLite DB, sessions, conversation history, IPC (on server only)

### Key env vars per agent (in `~/{user}/nanoclaw/.env` on server)

```
GROUPS_DIR=agents/cleo/groups   # or agents/silas/groups
DATA_DIR=data
CONTAINER_NAME_PREFIX=nc-cleo   # or nc-silas — must be unique per instance
ASSISTANT_NAME=Cleo             # or Silas
```

## Deployment

Manage from the dev laptop. Push to origin, then SSH to each server.

### Deploy Cleo
```bash
git push origin v2-migration
ssh cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "cd ~/nanoclaw && git pull --ff-only && pnpm install && pnpm run build 2>&1 | tail -5"
ssh cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "systemctl --user restart nanoclaw"
```

### Deploy Silas
```bash
ssh christina@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "cd ~/nanoclaw && git pull --ff-only && pnpm install && pnpm run build 2>&1 | tail -5"
ssh christina@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "systemctl --user restart nanoclaw"
```

### Rebuild Docker image (when `container/Dockerfile` changes)
```bash
ssh cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "docker build --no-cache -t nanoclaw-agent:latest ~/nanoclaw/container/ 2>&1 | tail -10"
```
Both agents share the same Docker image (`nanoclaw-agent:latest`). Rebuild once, applies to both.

## Logs and Debugging

```bash
# App logs
ssh cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "tail -50 ~/nanoclaw/logs/nanoclaw.log"
ssh cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "tail -30 ~/nanoclaw/logs/nanoclaw.error.log"
ssh christina@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "tail -50 ~/nanoclaw/logs/nanoclaw.log"

# Service status
ssh cian@cleo-lc.cognitivetech.net "systemctl --user status nanoclaw --no-pager | head -20"
```

## CJK font support

Agent containers ship without CJK fonts by default (~200MB saved). If you notice signals the user works with Chinese/Japanese/Korean content — conversing in CJK, CJK timezone (e.g., `Asia/Tokyo`, `Asia/Shanghai`, `Asia/Seoul`, `Asia/Taipei`, `Asia/Hong_Kong`), system locale hint, or mentions of needing to render CJK in screenshots/PDFs/scraped pages — offer to enable it:

```bash
# Ensure .env has INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=true (overwrite or append)
grep -q '^INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=' .env && sed -i.bak 's/^INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=.*/INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=true/' .env && rm -f .env.bak || echo 'INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=true' >> .env

# Rebuild and restart so new sessions pick up the new image
./container/build.sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw   # macOS
# systemctl --user restart nanoclaw                # Linux
```

`container/build.sh` reads `INSTALL_CJK_FONTS` from `.env` and passes it through as a Docker build-arg. Without CJK fonts, Chromium-rendered screenshots and PDFs containing CJK text show tofu (empty rectangles) instead of characters.
