# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. Architecture lives in `docs/`.

## Quick Context

The host is a single Node process that orchestrates per-session agent containers. Platform messages land via channel adapters, route through an entity model (users → messaging groups → agent groups → sessions), get written into the session's inbound DB, and wake a container. The agent-runner inside the container polls the DB, calls Claude, and writes back to the outbound DB. The host polls the outbound DB and delivers through the same adapter.

**Everything is a message.** There is no IPC, no file watcher, no stdin piping between host and container. The two session DBs are the sole IO surface.

## Entity Model

```
users (id "<channel>:<handle>", kind, display_name)
user_roles (user_id, role, agent_group_id)       — owner | admin (global or scoped)
agent_group_members (user_id, agent_group_id)    — unprivileged access gate
user_dms (user_id, channel_type, messaging_group_id) — cold-DM cache

agent_groups (workspace, memory, CLAUDE.md, personality, container config)
    ↕ many-to-many via messaging_group_agents (session_mode, trigger_rules, priority)
messaging_groups (one chat/channel on one platform; unknown_sender_policy)

sessions (agent_group_id + messaging_group_id + thread_id → per-session container)
```

Privilege is user-level (owner/admin), not agent-group-level. See [docs/isolation-model.md](docs/isolation-model.md) for the three isolation levels (`agent-shared`, `shared`, separate agents).

## Two-DB Session Split

Each session has **two** SQLite files under `data/v2-sessions/<session_id>/`:

- `inbound.db` — host writes, container reads. `messages_in`, routing, destinations, pending_questions, processing_ack.
- `outbound.db` — container writes, host reads. `messages_out`, session_state.

Exactly one writer per file — no cross-mount lock contention. Heartbeat is a file touch at `/workspace/.heartbeat`, not a DB update. Host uses even `seq` numbers, container uses odd.

## Central DB

`data/v2.db` holds everything that isn't per-session: users, user_roles, agent_groups, messaging_groups, wiring, pending_approvals, user_dms, chat_sdk_* (for the Chat SDK bridge), schema_version. Migrations live at `src/db/migrations/`.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point: init DB, migrations, channel adapters, delivery polls, sweep, shutdown |
| `src/router.ts` | Inbound routing: messaging group → agent group → session → `inbound.db` → wake |
| `src/delivery.ts` | Polls `outbound.db`, delivers via adapter, handles system actions (schedule, approvals, etc.) |
| `src/host-sweep.ts` | 60s sweep: `processing_ack` sync, stale detection, due-message wake, recurrence |
| `src/session-manager.ts` | Resolves sessions; opens `inbound.db` / `outbound.db`; manages heartbeat path |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns per-agent-group Docker containers with session DB + outbox mounts, OneCLI `ensureAgent` |
| `src/container-runtime.ts` | Runtime selection (Docker vs Apple containers), orphan cleanup |
| `src/access.ts` | `pickApprover`, `pickApprovalDelivery`, admin resolution for `NANOCLAW_ADMIN_USER_IDS` |
| `src/onecli-approvals.ts` | OneCLI credentialed-action approval bridge |
| `src/user-dm.ts` | Cold-DM resolution + `user_dms` cache |
| `src/group-init.ts` | Per-agent-group filesystem scaffold (CLAUDE.md, skills, agent-runner-src overlay) |
| `src/db/` | DB layer — agent_groups, messaging_groups, sessions, user_roles, user_dms, pending_*, migrations |
| `src/channels/` | Channel adapter infra (registry, Chat SDK bridge); specific channel adapters are skill-installed from the `channels` branch |
| `src/providers/` | Host-side provider container-config (`claude` baked in; `opencode` etc. installed from the `providers` branch) |
| `container/agent-runner/src/` | Agent-runner: poll loop, formatter, provider abstraction, MCP tools, destinations |
| `container/skills/` | Container skills mounted into every agent session |
| `groups/<folder>/` | Per-agent-group filesystem (CLAUDE.md, skills, per-group `agent-runner-src/` overlay) |
| `scripts/init-first-agent.ts` | Bootstrap the first DM-wired agent (used by `/init-first-agent` skill) |

## Channels and Providers (skill-installed)

Trunk does not ship any specific channel adapter or non-default agent provider. The codebase is the registry/infra; the actual adapters and providers live on long-lived sibling branches and get copied in by skills:

- **`channels` branch** — Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Teams, Linear, GitHub, iMessage, Webex, Resend, Matrix, Google Chat, WhatsApp Cloud (+ helpers, tests, channel-specific setup steps). Installed via `/add-<channel>` skills.
- **`providers` branch** — OpenCode (and any future non-default agent providers). Installed via `/add-opencode`.

Each `/add-<name>` skill is idempotent: `git fetch origin <branch>` → copy module(s) into the standard paths → append a self-registration import to the relevant barrel → `pnpm install <pkg>@<pinned-version>` → build.

## Self-Modification

One tier of agent self-modification today:

1. **`install_packages` / `add_mcp_server` / `request_rebuild`** — changes to the per-agent-group container config only (apt/npm deps, wire an existing MCP server). Admin approval, rebuild, container restart. `container/agent-runner/src/mcp-tools/self-mod.ts`.

A second tier (direct source-level self-edits via a draft/activate flow) is planned but not yet implemented.

## Secrets / Credentials / OneCLI

API keys, OAuth tokens, and auth credentials are managed by the OneCLI gateway. Secrets are injected into per-agent containers at request time — none are passed in env vars or through chat context. `src/onecli-approvals.ts`, `ensureAgent()` in `container-runner.ts`. Run `onecli --help`.

## Skills

Four types of skills. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy.

- **Channel/provider install skills** — copy the relevant module(s) in from the `channels` or `providers` branch, wire imports, install pinned deps (e.g. `/add-discord`, `/add-slack`, `/add-whatsapp`, `/add-opencode`).
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside `SKILL.md` (e.g. `/claw`).
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows (`/setup`, `/debug`, `/customize`, `/init-first-agent`, `/manage-channels`, `/init-onecli`, `/update-nanoclaw`).
- **Container skills** — loaded inside agent containers at runtime (`container/skills/`: `welcome`, `self-customize`, `agent-browser`, `slack-formatting`).

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time install, auth, service config |
| `/init-first-agent` | Bootstrap the first DM-wired agent (channel pick → identity → wire → welcome DM) |
| `/manage-channels` | Wire channels to agent groups with isolation level decisions |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, behavior changes |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-nanoclaw` | Bring upstream updates into a customized install |
| `/init-onecli` | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials |

## Contributing

Before creating a PR, adding a skill, or preparing any contribution, you MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers accepted change types, the four skill types and their guidelines, `SKILL.md` format rules, and the pre-submission checklist.

## Development

Run commands directly — don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
# Host (Node + pnpm)
pnpm run dev          # Host with hot reload
pnpm run build        # Compile host TypeScript (src/)
./container/build.sh  # Rebuild agent container image (nanoclaw-agent:latest)
pnpm test             # Host tests (vitest)

# Agent-runner (Bun — separate package tree under container/agent-runner/)
cd container/agent-runner && bun install   # After editing agent-runner deps
cd container/agent-runner && bun test      # Container tests (bun:test)
```

Container typecheck is a separate tsconfig — if you edit `container/agent-runner/src/`, run `pnpm exec tsc -p container/agent-runner/tsconfig.json --noEmit` from root (or `bun run typecheck` from `container/agent-runner/`).

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start|stop|restart nanoclaw
```

Host logs: `logs/nanoclaw.log` (normal) and `logs/nanoclaw.error.log` (errors only — some delivery/approval failures only show up here).

## Supply Chain Security (pnpm)

This project uses pnpm with `minimumReleaseAge: 4320` (3 days) in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. New package versions must exist on the npm registry for 3 days before pnpm will resolve them.

**Rules — do not bypass without explicit human approval:**
- **`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`**: Never add entries without human sign-off. If a package must bypass the release age gate, the human must approve and the entry must pin the exact version being excluded (e.g. `package@1.2.3`), never a range.
- **`onlyBuiltDependencies`**: Never add packages to this list without human approval — build scripts execute arbitrary code during install.
- **`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`** should be used in CI, automation, and container builds. Never run bare `pnpm install` in those contexts.

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.

## Container Runtime (Bun)

The agent container runs on **Bun**; the host runs on **Node** (pnpm). They communicate only via session DBs — no shared modules. Details and rationale: [docs/build-and-runtime.md](docs/build-and-runtime.md).

**Gotchas — trigger + action:**

- **Adding or bumping a runtime dep in `container/agent-runner/`** → edit `package.json`, then `cd container/agent-runner && bun install` and commit the updated `bun.lock`. Do not run `pnpm install` there — agent-runner is not a pnpm workspace.
- **Bumping `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, or any agent-runner runtime dep** → no `minimumReleaseAge` policy applies to this tree. Check the release date on npm, pin deliberately, never `bun update` blindly.
- **Writing a new named-param SQL insert/update in the container** → use `$name` in both SQL and JS keys: `.run({ $id: msg.id })`. `bun:sqlite` does not auto-strip the prefix the way `better-sqlite3` does on the host. Positional `?` params work normally.
- **Adding a test in `container/agent-runner/src/`** → import from `bun:test`, not `vitest`. Vitest runs on Node and can't load `bun:sqlite`. `vitest.config.ts` excludes this tree.
- **Adding a Node CLI the agent invokes at runtime** (like `agent-browser`, `claude-code`, `vercel`) → put it in the Dockerfile's pnpm global-install block, pinned to an exact version via a new `ARG`. Don't use `bun install -g` — that bypasses the pnpm supply-chain policy.
- **Changing the Dockerfile entrypoint or the dynamic-spawn command** (`src/container-runner.ts` line ~301) → keep `exec bun ...` so signals forward cleanly. The image has no `/app/dist`; don't reintroduce a tsc build step.
- **Changing session-DB pragmas** (`container/agent-runner/src/db/connection.ts`) → `journal_mode=DELETE` is load-bearing for cross-mount visibility. Read the comment block at the top of the file first.

## CJK font support

Agent containers ship without CJK fonts by default (~200MB saved). If you notice signals the user works with Chinese/Japanese/Korean content — conversing in CJK, CJK timezone (e.g., `Asia/Tokyo`, `Asia/Shanghai`, `Asia/Seoul`, `Asia/Taipei`, `Asia/Hong_Kong`), system locale hint, or mentions of needing to render CJK in screenshots/PDFs/scraped pages — offer to enable it:

```bash
# Ensure .env has INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=true (overwrite or append)
grep -q '^INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=' .env && sed -i.bak 's/^INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=.*/INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=true/' .env && rm -f .env.bak || echo 'INSTALL_CJK_FONTS=true' >> .env

# Rebuild and restart so new sessions pick up the new image
./container/build.sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw   # macOS
# systemctl --user restart nanoclaw                # Linux
```

`container/build.sh` reads `INSTALL_CJK_FONTS` from `.env` and passes it through as a Docker build-arg. Without CJK fonts, Chromium-rendered screenshots and PDFs containing CJK text show tofu (empty rectangles) instead of characters.
