# Add Resend Email Channel

Connect NanoClaw to email via Resend for async email conversations.

## Pre-flight

Check if `src/channels/resend.ts` exists and the import is uncommented in `src/channels/index.ts`. If both are in place, skip to Credentials.

## Install

```bash
npm install @resend/chat-sdk-adapter
```

Uncomment the Resend import in `src/channels/index.ts`:

```typescript
import './resend.js';
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Credentials

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account.
2. Add and verify your sending domain.
3. Go to **API Keys** and create a new key.
4. Set up a webhook:
   - Go to **Webhooks** > **Add webhook**.
   - URL: `https://your-domain/webhook/resend`.
   - Events: select **email.received**.
   - Copy the signing secret.

### Configure environment

Add to `.env`:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS=bot@yourdomain.com
RESEND_FROM_NAME=NanoClaw
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

Sync to container: `mkdir -p data/env && cp .env data/env/env`

## Next Steps

If you're in the middle of `/setup`, return to the setup flow now.

Otherwise, run `/manage-channels` to wire this channel to an agent group.

## Channel Info

- **type**: `resend`
- **terminology**: Resend handles email. Each email thread (identified by subject/In-Reply-To headers) is a separate conversation. The "from address" is the bot's identity.
- **how-to-find-id**: The platform ID is the from email address (e.g. `bot@yourdomain.com`). Each sender's email thread becomes its own conversation.
- **supports-threads**: yes (via email threading headers -- replies to the same thread stay together)
- **typical-use**: Async communication -- email conversations with longer response expectations
- **default-isolation**: Same agent group if you want your agent to handle email alongside other channels. Separate agent group if email contains sensitive correspondence that shouldn't be accessible from other channels.
