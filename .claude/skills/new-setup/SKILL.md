# NanoClaw bare-minimum setup

Purpose of this skill is to take any user — technical or not — from zero to a two-way chat with an agent in the fewest steps possible. Done means a running NanoClaw instance with at least one agent reachable via the CLI channel.

Only run the steps strictly required for the NanoClaw process to start and respond to the user end-to-end. Everything else is deferred to post-setup skills.

Before each step, narrate to the user in your own words what's about to happen — one short, friendly sentence, no jargon. Don't read a scripted line; use the step context below to speak naturally.

Each step is invoked as `pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step <name>` and emits a structured status block Claude parses to decide what to do next.

Start with a probe: a single parallel scan that snapshots every prerequisite and dependency. The rest of the flow reads this snapshot to decide what to run, skip, or ask about — no per-step re-checking. The probe is plain ESM JS (`setup/probe.mjs`) with no external deps so it can run before step 1 has installed `pnpm`/`node_modules`.

## Current state

!`bash setup/probe.sh`

## Flow

Parse the probe block above. For each step below, consult the named probe fields and skip, ask, or run accordingly.

If the probe reports `STATUS: unavailable` (Node isn't installed yet), ignore all `skip if …` probe conditions and run every step from 1 onward — each step has its own idempotency check, so re-running is safe.

## Ordering and parallelism

Run steps sequentially by default: invoke the step, wait for its status block, act on the result, move to the next.

One permitted parallelism:

- **Step 2 (container image build) and step 3 (OneCLI install)** are independent — they may start together in the background.
- **Step 4 (auth) must NOT start until step 3 has completed.** Auth writes the secret into the OneCLI vault; if OneCLI isn't installed and healthy yet, the user gets asked for a credential the system can't store. Do not open an `AskUserQuestion` for step 4 while OneCLI is still installing.
- Step 2's image build may continue running past step 4 — the image isn't consumed until step 6 (first CLI agent). Join before step 6.

### 1. Node bootstrap

If the probe reported `STATUS: unavailable` (Node isn't installed yet), install Node 22 **before** running `bash setup.sh` — otherwise the first bootstrap run is guaranteed to fail and you'll pay for it twice:

- macOS: `brew install node@22`
- Linux / WSL: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Then run `bash setup.sh`. If the probe reported any other status, run `bash setup.sh` directly — it's idempotent and verifies host deps + native modules.

Parse the status block:

- `NODE_OK=false` → Node install didn't take effect (PATH issue, keg-only formula, etc.). Investigate `logs/setup.log`, resolve, re-run.
- `DEPS_OK=false` or `NATIVE_OK=false` → Read `logs/setup.log`, fix, re-run.

> **Loose command:** `bash setup.sh`. Justification: pre-Node bootstrap. Can't call the Node-based dispatcher before Node and `pnpm install` are in place.

### 2. Docker

Check probe results and skip if `DOCKER=running` AND `IMAGE_PRESENT=true`.

**Runtime:**
- `DOCKER=not_found` → Docker itself is missing — install it so agent containers have an isolated place to run.
  - macOS: `brew install --cask docker && open -a Docker`
  - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` (tell user they may need to log out/in for group membership)
- `DOCKER=installed_not_running` → Docker is installed but the daemon is down — start it.
  - macOS: `open -a Docker`
  - Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

Wait ~15s after either, then proceed.

> **Loose commands:** Docker install/start. Justification: platform-specific package-manager invocations. Wrapping them in a `--step` would just move the same branching into TypeScript with no added value.

**Image (run if `IMAGE_PRESENT=false`):** build the agent container image — takes a few minutes the first time, one-off cost.

`pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step container -- --runtime docker`

### 3. OneCLI

Check probe results and skip if `ONECLI_STATUS=healthy`.

OneCLI is the local vault that holds API keys and only releases them to agents when they need them.

`pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step onecli`

### 4. Anthropic credential

Check probe results and skip if `ANTHROPIC_SECRET=true`.

The agent needs an Anthropic credential to talk to Claude. Two sources:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
1. **Claude subscription (Pro/Max)** — "Run `claude setup-token` in another terminal. It prints a token; paste it back here when ready."
2. **Anthropic API key** — "Get one from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys."

Wait for the token. When received, run:

`pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step auth -- --create --value <TOKEN>`

### 5. Service

Check probe results and skip if `SERVICE_STATUS=running`.

Start the NanoClaw background service — it relays messages between the user and the agent.

`pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step service`

### 6. First CLI agent

Check probe results and skip if `CLI_AGENT_WIRED=true`.

If step 2's container build is still running in the background, join it here before proceeding — the agent needs the image.

Create the first agent and wire it to the CLI channel. Ask the user "What should I call you?" first — default the offered value to `INFERRED_DISPLAY_NAME` from the probe.

`pnpm exec tsx setup/index.ts --step cli-agent -- --display-name "<name>"`

### 7. First chat

Everything's ready — send the first message to the agent.

`pnpm run chat hi`

The agent should reply within ~60s (first container spin-up is slowest). If no reply, tail `logs/nanoclaw.log`.

> **Loose command:** `pnpm run chat hi`. Justification: this is the command the user will keep using after setup. Hiding it behind a `--step` would force them to memorize a second way to do the same thing.

## If anything fails

Any step that reports `STATUS: failed` in its status block: read `logs/setup.log`, diagnose, fix the underlying cause, re-run the same `--step`. Don't bypass errors to keep moving.
